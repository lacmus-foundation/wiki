# ðŸ’¥ Quick Start

The [Lacmus](https://github.com/lacmus-foundation/lacmus-app) cross-platform application was specifically designed to assist search and rescue teams in locating missing individuals by utilizing the power of the [Lacmus neural network](https://github.com/lacmus-foundation/lacmus). Its intuitive graphical user interface allows users to easily process images captured from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and effectively search for people within said images using neural network algorithms. This software is a valuable tool for search and rescue operations and has the potential to save countless lives. It is compatible with various operating systems including Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. The application was developed utilizing the programming languages C#, .NET Core, [ReactiveUl](https://github.com/reactiveui/ReactiveUI), and [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia).
